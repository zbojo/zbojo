# Hi there 👋

I'm a **Computer Science student at TUKE** 🎓 with a strong interest in **software development**.  
One of my biggest passions is designing and programming **mechanisms for escape rooms** 🔐, especially here in **Košice, Slovakia**, where I live.  

I also enjoy game development and have created a **2D game using C and ncurses** 🎮 – definitely worth checking out!

I love combining creativity with technology – whether it's building electronic puzzles with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, or developing full-stack web applications with Laravel and Vue.js.  

Always curious, always learning. 🚀
